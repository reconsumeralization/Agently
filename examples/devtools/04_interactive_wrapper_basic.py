# Stable expected key output from the declared run:
# launched example prints the local DevTools or Interactive UI URL and streams/records the declared demo events.
#
# How it works:
# InteractiveWrapper wraps a streaming callable (a generator function here) in a local
# HTTP server that the agently-devtools UI connects to.  When a request arrives, the
# wrapper calls echo_handler(request_data), iterates the generator, and streams each
# chunk to the browser UI incrementally.  ObservationBridge is also registered but
# emits no runtime events because this example does not use an Agently agent.
# Print the ui_url and open it in a browser to see the streaming echo demo.
#
# Flow:
# InteractiveWrapper(echo_handler, title="...") -> starts local HTTP server
# interactive.ui_url -> http://localhost:<port>/?...
#   |  (browser sends request)
#   v
# echo_handler(request_data): yields 4 chunks with 0.2s sleep between each
# chunks streamed to browser: "Analyzing input...", "Echo: ...", "Length: ...", "Words: ..."
# interactive.wait() -> blocks until Ctrl-C
