# Stable expected key output from the declared run:
# snapshot.result.status == "completed" for topic "release readiness"; without a listener, a buffered ObservationBridge warning is expected.
#
# How it works:
# Agently.create_observation_bridge(...) lazily loads agently-devtools, binds the bridge
# to the Agently event center, and bridge.watch(Agently) forwards all observation events
# to the agently-devtools server.
# When the devtools server is not running, events are buffered locally and the flow
# still executes normally.  The snapshot from async_close() is the ground truth for
# local assertions; bridge events are best-effort observability side effects.
#
# Flow:
# Agently.create_observation_bridge(...) -> hooks installed
# bridge.watch(Agently) -> global observation scope
#   |
#   v
# prepare chunk: returns {"topic":"release readiness","status":"prepared"}
# finalize chunk: state["result"]["status"] = "completed"
#   |
#   v
# async_close() -> {"result":{"topic":"release readiness","status":"completed"}}
# bridge.unregister() -> hooks removed
