# Stable expected key output from the declared run:
# first execution keeps last_ping "one" and second execution keeps last_ping "two".
#
# How it works:
# TriggerFlowBlueprint defines a reusable event handler graph without being tied to
# a specific flow instance.  TriggerFlow(blueprint=...) instantiates a flow from it.
# Each create_execution() call produces an isolated execution with its own state —
# "one" and "two" stay in separate state dicts even though they run concurrently.
#
# Flow (two concurrent executions):
# Execution A: emit_nowait("PING", "one")  ->  on_ping  ->  state["last_ping"] = "one"
# Execution B: emit_nowait("PING", "two")  ->  on_ping  ->  state["last_ping"] = "two"
# asyncio.gather() runs both; first.last_ping=="one", second.last_ping=="two"
