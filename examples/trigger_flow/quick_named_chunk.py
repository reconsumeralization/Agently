# Stable expected key output from the declared run:
# state["normalized"] == "agently".
#
# How it works:
# @flow.chunk("normalize-input") is a decorator shorthand that both defines the async
# handler and registers it with an explicit name in the flow's chunk registry.
# The name is used in blueprints and Mermaid diagrams instead of the function's
# __name__.  The rest of the chain (flow.to(normalize).to(store)) is identical to
# registering without a decorator.
#
# Flow:
# async_start("  Agently  ")
#   |
#   v
# normalize  ("normalize-input")  ->  "agently"   (strip + lower)
#   |
#   v
# store  ->  state["normalized"] = "agently"
#   |
# async_close()  ->  "agently"
