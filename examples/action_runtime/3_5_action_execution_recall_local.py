# Expected key output:
# RAW ACTION RECORD contains model_digest and artifact_refs.
# MODEL-VISIBLE ACTION RESULTS contains the compact digest, not only raw stdout.
# RECALLED RAW ARTIFACT returns the saved action input for inspect_workspace.

# How it works:
# agent.action.execute_action() bypasses model planning entirely and calls the action
# directly with explicit arguments — useful for testing or scripted workflows.
# enable_shell() registers a bash action restricted to the "pwd" command.
# The raw ActionResult contains model_digest (a compact summary the model can read)
# and artifact_refs (pointers to full stored artifacts).
# agent.action.read_action_artifact() retrieves the raw artifact by artifact_id +
# action_call_id for audit or downstream use.
#
# Flow:
# agent.enable_shell(root=workspace, commands=["pwd"], action_id="inspect_workspace")
#   |
#   v
# agent.action.execute_action("inspect_workspace", {"cmd":"pwd","workdir":workspace})
#   | (no model call — direct execution)
#   v
# BashSandboxActionExecutor -> stdout = str(workspace)
# ActionResult { model_digest: ..., artifact_refs: [{ artifact_id, action_call_id }] }
#   |
#   v
# Action.to_action_results([records]) -> compact model-visible dict
# agent.action.read_action_artifact(artifact_id, action_call_id) -> raw artifact
