# Dynamic Task

Dynamic Task executes model-generated or app-generated DAGs with a compact
app-facing API. Internally it validates a `TaskDAG`, resolves task handlers,
and compiles the graph to ordinary TriggerFlow execution.

```python
task = Agently.create_dynamic_task(target="review policy")
result = await task.async_start()
```

When the caller already has a plan, pass the `TaskDAG` directly and skip model
planning:

```python
async def local_handler(context):
    return {
        "task_id": context.task.id,
        "deps": dict(context.dependency_results),
    }

task = Agently.create_dynamic_task(
    target="review policy",
    plan={
        "graph_id": "review",
        "task_schema_version": "task_dag/v1",
        "tasks": [
            {"id": "extract", "kind": "local", "binding": "local_handler"},
            {
                "id": "final",
                "kind": "local",
                "binding": "local_handler",
                "depends_on": ["extract"],
            },
        ],
        "semantic_outputs": {"final": "final"},
    },
    handlers={"local_handler": local_handler},
)
snapshot = await task.async_start(timeout=10)
```

Agent instances expose the same facade:

```python
task = agent.create_dynamic_task(target="review policy")
```

For model tasks, use Agently's request output pipeline instead of parsing model
text in handlers or examples. `output_schema` applies to semantic output model
tasks; node-level `inputs.output_schema` can override it for a specific model
task.

```python
task = Agently.create_dynamic_task(
    target="write an incident briefing",
    output_schema={
        "brief": (str, "customer-facing briefing", True),
        "next_update": (str, "next update timing", True),
    },
)
snapshot = await task.async_start(timeout=120)
_, output = next(iter(snapshot["semantic_outputs"].items()))
brief = output["result"]["brief"]
```

## Architecture

Dynamic Task is split into four stages:

- `AgentlyTaskDAGPlanner` generates deterministic `TaskDAG` data with Agently
  output schema, `ensure_keys`, and validation retry.
- `TaskDAGValidator` validates DAG syntax, dependencies, schema version,
  semantic outputs, side-effect policy, and resolver availability.
- `DynamicTaskResolver` maps `task.binding`, `task.id`, then `task.kind` to a
  runnable handler.
- `TaskDAGExecutor` compiles the validated DAG to ordinary TriggerFlow chunks
  and runs it through TriggerFlow lifecycle, stream, pause/resume, result, and
  runtime resource mechanics.

`bindings` is not part of the public facade. Use `handlers` for custom local
functions. Use explicit resource slots such as `planner`, `model`, `actions`,
and `skills` when a task may use them; `actions` and `skills` are not exposed to
the planner unless passed by the caller.

## Resolver Semantics

Custom handlers should use clear names ending in `_handler`:

```python
task = Agently.create_dynamic_task(
    target="review policy",
    plan=task_dag,
    handlers={"risk_check_handler": risk_check_handler},
)
```

In the DAG:

```python
{"id": "check_risk", "kind": "local", "binding": "risk_check_handler"}
```

Unknown optional handlers may be safely pruned by the validator when they do not
affect required semantic outputs, required downstream nodes, approvals, or
side-effect policy. Pruned nodes are recorded in `diagnostics`; unknown required
handlers fail closed before execution.

## Lower-Level Control

Use the low-level classes only when a framework integration needs staged
control:

```python
from agently.builtins.plugins import AgentlyTaskDAGPlanner
from agently.core import DynamicTaskResolver, TaskDAGExecutor, TaskDAGValidator

resolver = DynamicTaskResolver({"risk_check_handler": risk_check_handler})
validator = TaskDAGValidator(resolver)
planner = AgentlyTaskDAGPlanner(validator=validator)

graph = await planner.async_plan(planner_agent, {"target": "review policy"})
validation = validator.validate(graph, strict_schema_version=True)
snapshot = await TaskDAGExecutor(resolver, validator=validator).async_run(graph)
```

The executor does not depend on Agent. Model and action access belong to the
facade or resolver adapters, while TriggerFlow remains the execution substrate.

## Examples

Use the examples in `examples/dynamic_task/` by layer:

- `01_dynamic_task_basic.py`: submitted `TaskDAG` smoke example with local
  handlers only.
- `02_support_response_module_model.py`: model-powered support module with a
  simple `SupportResponseModule.respond(ticket)` facade, backend fan-out/join
  stages, structured model outputs, mocked business-system lookups, and a
  printed customer-facing response.
- `03_contract_risk_review_business.py`: contract risk review business example
  with a simple `ContractRiskReviewService.review(contract)` facade,
  deterministic local handlers, backend risk scoring, and a printed risk memo.
- `04_incident_briefing_auto_plan.py`: auto-planned incident briefing example
  with a simple `IncidentBriefingService.brief(report)` facade. The model
  creates the `TaskDAG`; Dynamic Task validates and executes it, while the
  frontstage briefing shape is enforced through Agently `output_schema`.
- `05_enterprise_renewal_complex_auto_plan.py`: complex auto-planned renewal
  example where the model planner creates several independent analysis roots,
  joins them into a synthesis stage, and produces a structured recovery package.
