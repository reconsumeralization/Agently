# Compatibility

> Languages: **English** · [中文](../../cn/triggerflow/compatibility.md)

This is the **only** page where deprecated TriggerFlow APIs appear as recommended starting points — for migration purposes. Everywhere else in the documentation should already be on the new APIs.

The high-level shift is: the new lifecycle treats the **close snapshot** as the canonical return value. Older APIs that tried to compute a single "result" — `.end()`, `set_result()`, `get_result()`, `wait_for_result=` — are kept as compatibility surfaces but are not recommended for new code.

## .end() — definition-time DSL, not a lifecycle action

`.end()` was historically used as the way to "finish" a flow. Its actual current behavior is narrower:

- It is a **definition-time** DSL — it appends a compatibility result sink to the flow at build time.
- It is **not** equivalent to `seal()`.
- It is **not** equivalent to `close()`.
- All it does at runtime is write whatever value flowed into it to the reserved state key `"$final_result"`.

Status: **Deprecated** — calls emit a deprecation warning.

### Old

```python
flow.to(step_a).to(step_b).end()  # writes step_b's return into "$final_result"
result = flow.start("input")
```

### New

```python
flow.to(step_a).to(step_b)  # no .end()
snapshot = flow.start("input")
# step_b's return value lands in whatever state key step_b wrote to,
# or you can capture it explicitly:

async def step_b(data):
    await data.async_set_state("answer", do_work(data.input))
```

If you have flow configs that still call `.end()`, they keep working — the value just lands in `snapshot["$final_result"]` instead of being framework-mediated.

## set_result() / get_result() — compatibility writer/reader

`set_result(value)` writes to the same `"$final_result"` state key. `get_result()` reads it (or falls back to the close snapshot).

Status: **Deprecated** — both emit deprecation warnings.

### Old

```python
async def worker(data):
    data.set_result({"answer": ...})
```

```python
result = execution.get_result()  # waits and returns
```

### New

```python
async def worker(data):
    await data.async_set_state("answer", ...)
```

```python
snapshot = await execution.async_close()
answer = snapshot["answer"]
```

If a single canonical result really is what you want and the rest of the snapshot is noise, just project it on the way out:

```python
async def project_answer(execution):
    snapshot = await execution.async_close()
    return snapshot["answer"]
```

## wait_for_result= — value is now ignored

`wait_for_result=True` / `False` was the old way to control whether `start(...)` waited for a result. The new lifecycle controls return type with `auto_close` instead.

Status: **Deprecated** — value is **ignored** with a warning.

### Old

```python
result = flow.start("input", wait_for_result=True)   # the parameter no longer matters
```

### New

For "wait and give me the close snapshot", use the hidden sugar:

```python
snapshot = await flow.async_start("input")           # always returns close snapshot
```

For "give me the execution and I'll close it myself":

```python
execution = flow.create_execution(auto_close=False)
await execution.async_start("input")                 # returns execution
# ... do work ...
snapshot = await execution.async_close()
```

See [Lifecycle](lifecycle.md) for the full table of entry APIs.

## runtime_data — old name for state

The old `runtime_data` API surface (`get_runtime_data`, `set_runtime_data`, `append_runtime_data`, `del_runtime_data`) is now an alias of the modern `state` API. It still works but emits deprecation warnings.

Status: **Deprecated** alias of `state`.

### Old

```python
async def step(data):
    await data.set_runtime_data("count", 1)
    n = data.get_runtime_data("count")
```

### New

```python
async def step(data):
    await data.async_set_state("count", 1)
    n = data.get_state("count")           # sync read also exists
```

The semantics haven't changed — just the names. See [State and Resources](state-and-resources.md).

## flow_data — risky-default, not deprecated

`flow_data` is a third storage layer with a different problem: it's flow-scoped (shared across **all** executions of the flow). It still works, but every call emits a `RuntimeWarning` because of the concurrency / save-load risks.

Status: **Risky-default** — works, but warns. Not the same as deprecation.

If you intentionally need shared scope, suppress the warning:

```python
flow.set_flow_data("shared_counter", 0, no_warning=True)
```

For 99% of use cases the right answer is `state` (per-execution) or `runtime_resources` (live objects). See [State and Resources](state-and-resources.md).

## $final_result in close snapshots

Even after migration, you'll see `"$final_result"` in close snapshots if any `.end()` or `set_result()` ran during the execution — including inside sub-flows or shared library code you don't control. The bridge logic in `to_sub_flow(...)` deliberately checks for `$final_result` first when resolving `result.<path>` write-backs, exactly so legacy children continue to work alongside new state-first parents. See [Sub-Flow](sub-flow.md).

## Migration checklist

For each flow:

1. Remove `.end()` from definitions. Decide which state key carries the value you actually want.
2. Replace `set_result(x)` with `async_set_state("answer", x)` (or whatever the meaningful key is).
3. Replace `get_result()` with reading the relevant key from the close snapshot.
4. Drop `wait_for_result=` arguments — they don't do anything anymore.
5. Replace `set_runtime_data` / `get_runtime_data` with `async_set_state` / `get_state`.
6. Audit `flow_data` calls. Most should be `state`; the rest should suppress the warning intentionally.
7. Audit live objects in state. Move them to `runtime_resources`.
