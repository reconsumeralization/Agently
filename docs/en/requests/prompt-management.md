# Prompt Management

> Languages: **English** · [中文](../../cn/requests/prompt-management.md)

Agently splits a prompt into named slots. The slots compose, so you can set persistent agent context once and only fill request-specific slots per call.

## Slot map

| Slot | Where it ends up | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `role` / `system` | system message | persona, capability boundaries |
| `info` | system or user (impl detail) | background facts, inventories, tool catalogs |
| `instruct` | user message | step-by-step instructions for this kind of request |
| `input` | user message | the actual question or payload |
| `output` | user message + parser | the schema you want back |

## Keep one request contract local

For a one-off request, keep its related information visible in one review path.
The `input`, authoritative `info`, `instruct`, `output` schema, and result
consumption should normally form one readable execution block:

```python
result = (
    agent
    .input({"ticket_text": ticket_text})
    .info({"allowed_queues": allowed_queues})
    .instruct("Select the best queue and give one concise explanation.")
    .output({
        "queue": (str, "One value from allowed_queues.", True),
        "explanation": (str, "Concise user-visible explanation.", True),
    })
    .get_result()
)
triage = await result.async_get_data()
```

A single YAML/JSON Prompt Configure file loaded with explicit `mappings` is the
same kind of cohesive contract when prompt behavior should evolve outside
Python. Extract a schema or prompt fragment only when it is reused unchanged,
owned and versioned by another interface/module, independently reviewed or
product-edited, or genuinely generated or conditional. Keep that owner directly
discoverable from the call site.

Moving a one-use schema into a distant constant, tiny getter, request builder,
or forwarding wrapper solely to shorten the chain adds review-time lookup count
and depth without adding an owner. That is not useful abstraction. Conversely,
do not force unrelated responsibilities into one large function or file: group
information that changes together and serves the same consumer.

## Strict external interface contracts

When model output will be passed directly to a documented API request, module
interface, or function call, the interface contract must be visible to the
model. A Python signature, OpenAPI operation, JSON Schema, protobuf definition,
or authoritative docstring is not automatically available to an ordinary
model request.

Use the slots as one integration contract:

| Slot | Integration responsibility |
|---|---|
| `input` | Request-specific values and source facts. |
| `info` | The authoritative API/schema documentation, signature, docstring, field semantics, and declared constraints. |
| `instruct` | How to transform the input, what callable or operation is being targeted, and how to handle missing information. |
| `output` | The exact machine-consumable type and nested shape expected by the downstream interface. |

For every downstream-consumed output field, describe its meaning and declare
its type, requiredness, and any applicable enum, format, range, nullability, or
cross-field constraint. Reusing these authoritative interface facts is boundary
and output control, not business-logic intrusion. Business decisions that are
not part of the interface contract still belong in the owning application
policy, and the host should run deterministic validation before the real call.

```python
from typing import Literal

ticket_body = await (
    agent
    .input({
        "request_text": request_text,
        "requester_id": requester_id,
    })
    .info({
        "target_operation": "POST /tickets",
        "operation_contract": openapi_ticket_operation,
    })
    .instruct([
        "Build one POST /tickets request body from the input facts.",
        "Follow the target operation contract exactly; do not add fields.",
    ])
    .output({
        "title": (
            str,
            "Non-empty ticket title accepted by POST /tickets.",
            "not_null",
        ),
        "priority": (
            Literal["low", "normal", "high"],
            "Required API enum: low, normal, or high.",
            True,
        ),
        "requester_id": (
            str,
            "Required requester identifier copied from the input.",
            "not_null",
        ),
    }, format="json")
    .async_start()
)
```

Setting a slot persistently:

```python
agent = (
    Agently.create_agent()
    .role("You are an Agently support assistant.", always=True)
    .info({"product": "Agently 4.x"}, always=True)
)
```

`always=True` keeps the slot at the agent level so it carries to every request the agent runs.

Setting a slot for one request:

```python
result = (
    agent
    .instruct(["Reply in fewer than 80 words.", "Never invent product names."])
    .input("How do I configure a model?")
    .output({"answer": (str, "answer", True)})
    .start()
)
```

`instruct(...)` here is per-request because `always=True` was not passed.

## Agent vs execution scope

| Scope | API |
|---|---|
| Agent definition (persists for every future execution) | `.define(...)`, `.role(..., always=True)`, `.info(..., always=True)`, `.set_agent_prompt(key, value)` |
| AgentExecution draft (one execution only) | `.input(...)`, `.output(...)`, `.set_execution_prompt(key, value)` |

The slot you set last wins for that scope, so you can override agent defaults in one execution without mutating the agent.

## YAML / JSON prompt files

Same slot model, written declaratively:

```yaml
# prompts/triage.yaml
$ensure_all_keys: true
.agent:
  system: You are a ticket triage assistant.
  info:
    severities: ["P0", "P1", "P2", "P3"]
.execution:
  instruct: Classify the ticket text.
  output:
    $format: json
    severity:
      $type: str
      $desc: One of P0/P1/P2/P3
      $ensure: true
    rationale:
      $type: str
      $desc: One-line reason
      $ensure: true
```

Loading:

```python
agent = Agently.create_agent().load_yaml_prompt("prompts/triage.yaml")

result = (
    agent
    .create_execution()
    .set_execution_prompt("input", "Login fails for all users in EU region.")
    .start()
)
```

`load_json_prompt(...)` is the same API for JSON. Both accept either a path or a raw string body. Pick one config file per prompt or stack multiple prompts with `prompt_key_path="demo.output_control"` to select inside a multi-prompt file.

Prompt config uses `.execution` for one execution. Turn/request-scoped prompt
config aliases are removed; update older prompt files to `.execution`.

`$ensure_all_keys: true` at the top makes all leaves required regardless of per-leaf `$ensure`. Use it when the entire schema must come back complete.

`$format` on the `output` block maps to the same output format setting as
`.output(..., format=...)`. Supported values are `auto`, `json`,
`flat_markdown`, `hybrid`, `xml_field`, and `yaml_literal`. You can also use
`.format`, `$output_format`, or `.output_format` when a config file needs a more
explicit key.

## Round-tripping

You can convert a Python-built prompt back to YAML/JSON for review or storage:

```python
execution = agent.role("You are an Agently agent.", always=True).input("Say hello.").output({
    "reply": (str, "reply", True),
})
print(execution.get_yaml_prompt())
print(execution.get_json_prompt())
print(execution.get_prompt_text())  # the rendered text the model will see
```

This round-trip is the canonical way to compare "what I think I'm sending" against "what the framework actually sends".

## Placeholders

Inside any prompt slot, `{name}` references another slot by key, and `${name}` is replaced by `mappings={"name": "value"}` at load time. Common patterns:

- `instruct: "Reply {input} politely."` — pulls the request `input` into the instruct text.
- `${ENV.OPENAI_API_KEY}` in *settings* (not prompts) is replaced by the env var; prompts use `${name}` with explicit mappings.
- `${INPUT.customer}`, `${INFO.policy}`, and `${INSTRUCT.step}` are render-time
  slot references. They become prompt section pointers such as
  `[INPUT > customer]` instead of copying slot values into another slot. Slot
  names are case-insensitive; docs use uppercase. The path after the slot name
  is not validated because it is only a model-facing reference label.
- `${OUTPUT}` is an alias for `[OUTPUT REQUIREMENT]`.

To trigger placeholder substitution while loading, pass `mappings=...` explicitly:

```python
agent.load_yaml_prompt(yaml_text, mappings={"product_name": "Agently"})
```

## Where each layer's prompt comes from

When a request runs, Agently composes the final prompt by stacking:

1. Agent-level slots (set with `always=True` or `set_agent_prompt`)
2. Request-level slots (set without `always=True`)
3. Slots populated by framework extensions or application code (Session injects chat history; retrieval code usually puts snippets into per-request `info(...)`)

Use `execution.get_prompt_text()` after one-run chaining, for example
`execution = agent.input(...).output(...)`, to see the merged result before
sending. `agent.get_prompt_text()` only inspects prompt data kept on the Agent
itself, such as slots set with `always=True`.
