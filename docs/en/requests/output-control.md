# Output Control

> Languages: **English** · [中文](../../cn/requests/output-control.md)

The validation pipeline runs the first time a structured response result is consumed, then caches the outcome on that response result. It has a fixed order, and each step contributes to the same retry budget.

For Agently `4.1.0.1+`, the default authoring path is: mark fixed required leaves directly in `.output(...)` with the third-slot `ensure` flag, then let the runtime compile those flags into `ensure_keys`. Pass `ensure_keys=` manually only when the required path is runtime-dependent, conditional, or easier to express outside the static schema.

## The pipeline

```text
   model returns text
        │
        ▼
1. parse / repair         ← extract structured object from text
        │
        ▼
2. strict output          ← match against .output(...) shape; ensure_all_keys checks if set
        │
        ▼
3. ensure_keys            ← per-leaf required-path checks (compiled from the ensure flag)
        │
        ▼
4. custom validate        ← .validate(handler) and validate_handler= business rules
        │
        ▼
   pass → return result   |   fail → retry (if budget remains) → top of pipeline
```

A failure at any step retries the request. Retries share one budget controlled by `max_retries` (default `3`). When the budget is exhausted:

- `raise_ensure_failure=True` (the default) — raises.
- `raise_ensure_failure=False` — returns the latest parsed result anyway.

## Where validate plugs in

`.validate(handler)` registers a custom check. It runs **after** strict output and `ensure_keys` have already passed, on a canonical dict snapshot of the result.

```python
def must_be_short(result, ctx):
    if len(result.get("answer", "")) > 280:
        return {"ok": False, "reason": "answer too long", "validator_name": "length"}
    return True

agent.input("Summarize.").output({
    "answer": (str, "answer", True),
}).validate(must_be_short).start()
```

The handler runs only on structured-result getters: `start()`, `async_start()`, `get_data()`, `async_get_data()`, `get_data_object()`, `async_get_data_object()`. It does **not** run on `get_text()` / `get_meta()` (those don't carry the parsed structure that validate would inspect).

## Ordered Fields And Evaluation Levels

Agently output schemas are ordered. When later fields depend on earlier
judgment, put support fields first: evidence, assumptions, clarifications,
source notes, calculation plans, concise rationale, rule checks, and
intermediate facts. Put final booleans, verdicts, replies, summaries, and action
decisions last. User-facing renderers can reorder sections for natural reading,
but the model generation contract should keep support-before-conclusion order.

For model-owned grading, confidence, trust, relevance, usability, or quality
judgments, prefer conceptual levels with explicit definitions over precise
numeric scores. For example, ask for `high_trust`, `moderate_trust`, or
`low_trust`, and define each level in the prompt. If downstream code needs a
score for thresholds, weighting, statistics, or index calculations, map levels
to deterministic numbers in code after generation.

For complex arithmetic, long-number calculation, weighting, aggregation, or
statistical transformations, ask the model for an executable calculation plan or
code, run it with tools, and pass the original question, code, and observed
result into the next model step. Do not make text generation be the calculator.

You can also pass handlers per-call:

```python
agent.input("...").output({...}).start(validate_handler=must_be_short)
agent.input("...").output({...}).start(validate_handler=[check_a, check_b])
```

`.validate(...)` handlers run before `validate_handler=` handlers. Multiple `.validate(...)` calls preserve order.

## Handler return shape

| Return | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `True` | pass |
| `False` | fail — retry if budget remains |
| `dict` | structured result; see keys below |

Supported `dict` keys:

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ok` | `True` = pass, `False` = fail |
| `reason` | text shown in retry events / error messages |
| `payload` | structured details for downstream consumers |
| `validator_name` | tag the validator in events |
| `no_retry` / `stop` | fail but don't retry |
| `error` / `exception` / `raise` | fail with the given exception |

Anything not in this list becomes a `model.validation_error` and consumes retry budget.

## Async handlers

Both sync and async handlers are supported. An async handler signature:

```python
async def check_remote(result, ctx):
    ok = await some_external_check(result["answer"])
    return ok
```

## Context object

The second argument is an `OutputValidateContext` with at least:

- `value`, `input`, `agent_name`, `response_id`
- `attempt_index`, `retry_count`, `max_retries`
- `prompt`, `settings`, `request_run_context`, `model_run_context`
- `response_text`, `raw_text`, `parsed_result`, `result_object`, `typed`, `meta`

Use `ctx.attempt_index` if you want different behavior on later attempts (e.g., loosen the rule on retry).

Treat these fields as observational by default, but `ctx.prompt` and `ctx.settings` are live state objects for the current response-attempt chain. In advanced handlers, if you need to adjust the prompt / options / settings for a **later retry**, you can write back through them inside the validator.

For example, lower sampling parameters on the next retry:

```python
def check(result, ctx):
    if result.get("score", 0) < 0.8 and ctx.retry_count < ctx.max_retries:
        ctx.prompt.set("options", {"temperature": 0.2, "top_p": 0.7})
        return {"ok": False, "reason": "score too low"}
    return True
```

Or change settings:

```python
def check(result, ctx):
    if should_switch_mode(result):
        ctx.settings.set("my_plugin.some_flag", True)
        return False
    return True
```

Two caveats:

- These writes affect **later retries only**. They do not change the current attempt that has already completed.
- These writes also do **not** leak into later fresh requests. Each new `response` is created from a new prompt/settings snapshot at the request/agent layer, so validator write-backs stay inside the current response's retry chain.
- Do not rely on mutating `opts = ctx.prompt.get("options", {})` in place. `get()` returns a view/copy; use write APIs such as `ctx.prompt.set(...)`, `ctx.prompt.update(...)`, or `ctx.settings.set(...)` if you need the change to persist.

## Single execution per response

Validation runs **once** per `ModelResponseResult` and the outcome is cached. Repeated calls — `get_data()` then `get_data()` again, or `get_data()` then `get_data_object()` — do **not** rerun validators. If you try to inject a different handler on the same response after validation has already finalized, the new handler is ignored with a warning.

This means: don't expect to swap validators per consumer. If you need different validation for different consumers, run the request twice.

## Retry events and visibility

Validation contributes two new observation event types:

- `model.validation_failed` — handler returned a fail
- `model.validation_error` — handler raised, returned an unsupported value, etc.

There is intentionally **no** `model.validation_passed` event in phase 1 — passing is the silent default.

The standard `model.retrying` event picks up validation-specific fields when the retry came from validate:

- `retry_reason`, `validator_name`, `validation_reason`, `validation_payload`

Agently-DevTools consumes these defensively. New event keys are additive and should not break existing dashboards.

## Combining with ensure_keys

`ensure_keys` and `.validate(...)` are layered:

- `ensure_keys` handles **path presence** (compiled from the `ensure` flag in `.output(...)`).
- `.validate(...)` handles **value rules** that depend on the actual content.

For fixed required leaves, prefer `(TypeExpr, "description", True)` in `.output(...)` rather than manually repeating the same paths in `ensure_keys=`. Use manual `ensure_keys` for conditional or runtime-only paths. Use `.validate(...)` for "this field must satisfy this business rule".

## Common patterns

**Loosen on the last retry**:

```python
def check(result, ctx):
    if ctx.attempt_index == ctx.max_retries:
        return True  # accept whatever came back
    return strict_check(result)
```

**Fail without retrying** (e.g., validation reveals a permanent business issue):

```python
def policy_check(result, ctx):
    return {"ok": False, "reason": "policy violation", "no_retry": True}
```

**Raise a custom exception**:

```python
def policy_check(result, ctx):
    return {"ok": False, "raise": MyDomainError("rejected by policy")}
```
