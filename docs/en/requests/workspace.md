# Task context, files, and records

Agently separates four responsibilities that were previously exposed through
one ambiguous Workspace concept.

| Owner | Responsibility | Does not own |
|---|---|---|
| `TaskContext` | Task-scoped information aggregate, direct entries, source bindings, and one internal derived index lifecycle | Files, persistence, semantic execution routing |
| `ContextReader` | Consumer/phase-bound retrieval and progressive disclosure; returns `ContextPackage` | Source storage, writes, side effects |
| `TaskWorkspace` | One explicit task file boundary: containment, mutation policy, format-aware readback, digest and file refs | Records, memory, snapshots, Skill selection |
| `RecordStore` | Durable records, retrieval indexes, links, checkpoints, TriggerFlow snapshots/events, memory persistence | Task files, prompt assembly, semantic relevance judgment |

`ContextSource` adapters make source-specific information readable without
moving source truth into `TaskContext`. A source exposes structural descriptors
through `async_enumerate_descriptors(...)` and bounded canonical content through
`async_read_exact(...)`; it does not choose cross-source relevance. Built-in
adapters cover SkillLibrary, TaskWorkspace, RecordStore, and SessionMemory
recall. Applications may attach their own source kind, such as an authorized
pinned-repository adapter.

## File boundary: TaskWorkspace

```python
from agently import Agently, TaskWorkspace

task_workspace = TaskWorkspace("./project", mode="read_only")
agent = Agently.create_agent("repo-review").use_task_workspace(
    "./project",
    mode="read_only",
)
```

The configured path is the ordinary file root. Existing external files remain
read-only unless `mode="read_write"` is selected. When a read-only boundary
needs a new execution product, Agently uses the execution fallback under
`.agently/files/<execution-id>/`; it does not overwrite an existing external
file. TaskWorkspace private locator and content-version identity metadata stays
under its own `.agently` area.

Agents without an explicit path receive isolated defaults under
`<entry-directory>/.agently/task_workspaces/<agent-id>`. Two Agents therefore
do not silently share a task file boundary.

Expose file operations to the model only when the task needs them:

```python
agent.enable_task_workspace_file_actions(
    read=True,
    write=True,
    expose_to_model=True,
)
```

TaskWorkspace produces stable locator and content-version facts for host-side
readback. A short application citation alias such as `[[ref:ref_1]]` is a
request-local display alias, not durable identity. Host code validates it and
maps it back to the canonical reference identity.

For a required AgentTask deliverable, the candidate bytes are first written as
a staged candidate and completely read back for terminal verification. Only
after verifier acceptance does TaskWorkspace perform digest-pinned atomic
promotion to the declared target and completely read the promoted bytes again.
Verification rejection leaves the previous target untouched; promotion or
post-promotion readback failure changes the task to a blocked result rather
than claiming delivery.

## Persistence boundary: RecordStore

```python
from agently.core.storage import RecordStore

record_store = RecordStore("./project-state", mode="read_write")
agent.use_record_store(record_store)

ref = await record_store.put(
    {"status": "verified"},
    collection="observations",
    kind="review_result",
    scope={"task_id": "review-42"},
)
```

The local provider materializes records at
`<root>/.agently/records/records.db`. Binding a RecordStore does not create or
change a TaskWorkspace. `SessionMemory` and TriggerFlow durability use
RecordStore ports.

TriggerFlow can opt out of its default RecordStore view with
`record_store=False`, or bind an explicit store:

```python
execution = flow.create_execution(
    record_store=record_store,
    runtime_resources={"runtime_event_store": record_store},
    auto_close=False,
)
```

AgentTask process state stays in memory and runtime logs by default. Enable
`record_store_recovery` only when restart recovery is required. Recovery refs
are RecordStore refs; final deliverable files remain TaskWorkspace refs.

## Information delivery: TaskContext and ContextReader

```python
from agently.core.context import TaskContext
from agently.core.storage import RecordStoreContextSource
from agently.types.data import ContextBudget, ContextReadIntent

task_context = TaskContext("review-42")
task_context.put(
    role="instruction",
    content="Never modify source files during review.",
    required=True,
)
task_context.attach(
    RecordStoreContextSource(record_store),
    binding_id="review-records",
    scope="task",
)

reader = task_context.reader(
    consumer="review-planner",
    phase="planning",
    budget=ContextBudget(max_chars=6000, max_blocks=12),
)
package = await reader.async_read(
    ContextReadIntent(
        query="What evidence is relevant to the failed review?",
        filters={"source_kinds": ["record_store"]},
    )
)
```

`TaskContext` is the only task-information aggregate. TaskContext owns source
bindings and one internal `ContextIndex` that builds, synchronizes, invalidates,
and reuses derived source partitions. ContextIndex is not a public manager and
never becomes canonical source truth. TaskContext creates readers with
`task_context.reader(...)` and restores their exported state with
`task_context.restore_reader(...)`; constructing or restoring a
`ContextReader` independently is not supported. The reader is a public,
consumer/phase-bound handle, comparable to an execution handle owned by its
aggregate. `ContextPackage` is the immutable value returned across a request,
AgentTask, Blocks, or persistence boundary; it is not another context owner.

Each reader pins one TaskContext/source revision snapshot. If that snapshot
is already stale before a read, refresh it explicitly or create a new reader.
If candidate listing itself advances a source revision while the TaskContext
structure remains unchanged (for example, a source establishes a lazy read
view), ContextReader optimistically re-pins and recollects once. Repeated or
concurrent mutation still fails closed. Required and explicitly requested blocks
cannot be silently dropped. Optional prose relevance uses an Agently
`ModelRequest` semantic selector when more than one candidate needs judgment;
selection keys are host-issued and validated before canonical records are
reconstructed.

ContextIndex enumerates source descriptors into revision/profile/provider-keyed
partitions. It may use `structural`, `lexical`, or host-configured `hybrid`
candidate retrieval, but exact bytes still come from the source's
`async_read_exact(...)` port. Reusable partitions may avoid rebuilding
unchanged embeddings; vector failure degrades only when policy allows it and is
reported in package diagnostics. ContextReader owns consumer-local offsets,
deduplication, optional ModelRequest selection, exact readback, and package
budgets. The returned package exposes per-binding `source_coverage` and index
diagnostics, never internal cache keys or provider vectors.

Context delivery is media-aware. Plain text and source-parsed text may enter a
package; the built-in TaskWorkspace source parses supported PDF, DOCX, XLSX,
and PPTX files before disclosure. A document whose parser or optional
dependency is unavailable is ref-only. Images, archives, executables, audio,
video, unknown formats, and arbitrary bytes are never coerced into guessed
text. Their index projection is limited to the canonical filename/ref.

An image is ref-only unless the exact consumer explicitly declares image
attachment support:

```python
from agently.types.data import ContextConsumer

reader = task_context.reader(
    consumer=ContextConsumer(
        "visual-reviewer",
        capabilities={"attachments": {"image": True}},
    ),
)
```

For AgentTask, declare the same capability on the selected task strategy:

```python
execution = agent.goal("Review the attached chart").strategy(
    "taskboard",
    context_consumer_capabilities={"attachments": {"image": True}},
)
```

Agently does not infer vision support from a model name or from a generic
`attachments=True` flag. When explicitly supported, ContextReader emits a
validated image attachment block and AgentTask binds it through the
ModelRequest attachment channel; the data URL is not serialized into the text
context pack. Image interpretation remains model-owned. An invalid or empty
attachment fails the selected read instead of falling back to a filename-based
guess.

Required content remains fail-closed when it cannot fit. A caller that has
explicitly accepted a lossy projection may request
`metadata={"required_overflow": "lossy_digest"}`. Skill sources then return a
bounded `completeness="lossy"` outline with the immutable full ref, ordered
section refs, original size, and omission facts; they do not silently truncate
the authority-bearing instructions. Optional section candidates still use the
semantic selector. A host-only preflight that intentionally wants no optional
selection may additionally set `optional_selection="none"`.

AgentTask carries the same policy in its context budget:

```python
execution = agent.goal(goal, success_criteria=criteria).strategy(
    "taskboard",
    context_budget={
        "chars": 12_000,
        "required_overflow": "lossy_digest",
    },
)
```

Use this only when the Skill or caller accepts lossy disclosure. Otherwise use
a larger/focused consumer or let the required Skill fail before business work.

`source_kinds` is structural source filtering, not semantic routing and not a
closed enumeration. Valid values come from the source kinds actually attached
to that TaskContext, including built-in adapters such as `task_workspace`,
`record_store`, `skill_library`, `session_memory`, or `pinned_repository` when present. Unknown
kinds fail before source enumeration.

AgentTask creates an independent reader/package for each concrete planner,
worker, control-card, and verifier request. A successful response records a
`ContextConsumption` with the exact package, response/request id, phase, and
block ids; failed requests record no consumption and emit no
`skills.context.bound` event. AgentTask meta exposes both `context_packages`
and `context_consumptions` for audit.

## AgentExecution ownership

Every AgentExecution owns one TaskContext and execution-scoped views of the
Agent's TaskWorkspace and RecordStore. AgentTask reuses the exact TaskContext
and TaskWorkspace view handed to it by AgentExecution. Skills are bound as
immutable SkillLibrary revisions through a Skill ContextSource; they do not
create a Skills route or execution engine.

With `record_store_recovery` enabled, the durable snapshot also preserves
TaskContext direct entries, reconstructible built-in source bindings, reader
disclosure history, packages, and consumptions. Skill sources are rebuilt from
their exact immutable `revision_ref`. Custom ContextSources are not
automatically reconstructible and fail resume explicitly instead of disappearing.

Use `execution.async_read_task_context(consumer_id=..., phase=..., intent=...)`
when the ordinary AgentExecution should build the package. `intent` accepts a
query string or `ContextReadIntent`; when omitted, AgentExecution uses its task
target. Blocks accepts an already
bound `context_reader` for its read-only `context_read` block.
